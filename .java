 * This is the main driver for the Tic-Tac-Toe game
  
 * Algorithm:
 * Display purpose
 * Prompt player x to enter their move
 * Check if it is a valid move, if so, place the move, if not, have them enter another move
 * After a valid move is made, check if the player is a winner, if they are end the game and display who the winner is
 * Do these same steps for player o
 * After the game is over, prompt the players to enter 1 or 0 to play again or not
 * If 1 is entered, rerun program, otherwise exit and display the results containing the number of games and how many games each player won
